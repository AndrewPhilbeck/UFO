# Analysis UFO Sightings: Fact of Fancy site

## Analysis Overview

The purpose of the website is to create awareness of UFO sightings all over the world by allowing people to search a variety of categories (Date, City, State, Country, Shape _of UFO_) and thus realize the likelihood that we are not alone. 

The purpose of the analysis is to view the sight and see if this is accomplished and address possible drawbacks and potential recommendations. 

## Website Results 

The site is clean and easy to use thanks to the Filter Search area along the left side of the page.

With only the place holders we see the current data based on the date 1/1/2010.

## Preforming a Search

If a parameter is entered in any of the fields, like the abbreviation for the state of Indiana (in) we see there is only one result with the date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments section of the page.

In this regard the site works smoothly. Removing the search parameter brings the user back to the original page. Searching an area with no results produces no results (for example typing in the state of Oklahoma (ok). 

## Summary

What the website can do it does well. However, the amount of data is incredibly small and from a specific time frame of more than a decade ago. This, while interesting, doesn’t lend credibility to continued visits from other worldly creatures. 

### Recommendations

+ Get more data than a two-week window in 2010 for sightings.
+ Either, do not make Roswell a placeholder for the Filter Search on the City tab _or_ get the information from the Roswell, NM crash for the site. 
+ Add search filters for “Duration” and “Comments” if people are interested in searching for UFO appearances which last a certain amount of time or perhaps consistent comments people make after a sighting to look for similarities in occurrences.
